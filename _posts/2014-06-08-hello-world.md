Hello there! I am re-building my website after 2 years of running it off [Openshift][1]. Before this, from 2010 to 2014 it ran on [WordPress][2].

I hope to write a few useful articles to share some of the things I’ve learnt over the last few years, and talk about the things I’m doing. Hope to see you around. Some notes:

This site is static HTML generated by the [Jekyll][3] static site engine written in Ruby. I haven’t used Jekyll, or Static-Site generators before, and am more comfortable with WordPress or Drupal. But Jekyll seems quite nice so far and does things a little differently. Additionally it was one of the most refreshingly simple installation procedures I’ve ever encountered, also integrating with github is one of great feature that made it free for you to host your blog or site on [github][4].
